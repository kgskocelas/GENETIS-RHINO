-------------
** PHASE 1 **
-------------
HANDOFF FROM KATE TO MAX:

[ ] Look at error in parameters.py

[ ] Look at Warnings in:
    1. Analysis.py (ask Evan if unsure)
    2. Evolver.py
    3. fitness_functions.py (ask Emily if unsure)
    4. ga_selectors.py

[ ] Fix failing test_fitness_functions.py (broke when we turned code into
            python package, so it's something to do with that file structure
            change)

[ ] Confirm config.toml settings that are flagged with TODO's (the rest were
already confirmed during meetings)


-------------
** PHASE 2 **
-------------
CODE:
[ ] MAX - Switch from dummy fitness function to real fitness function
[ ] EMILY - phylogeny tracking
[ ] KATE - Code simple crossover

TESTING:
[ ] MAX - test integration with XFdtd
[ ] EMILY - test phylogeny tracking
[ ] KATE - test simple crossover
